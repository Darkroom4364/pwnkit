# @pwnkit/benchmark

Benchmark runners for pwnkit across multiple security evaluation suites
(XBOW, AutoPenBench, CyBench, HarmBench, NPM advisories).

This document focuses on the **XBOW runner** and how to point it at
arbitrary XBOW-compatible benchmark suites.

For public benchmark publication, do not treat ad hoc `xbow-latest.json`
files or markdown notes as the canonical score surface. The current repo
keeps an explicit benchmark ledger at
`packages/benchmark/results/benchmark-ledger.json` to separate:

- retained artifact-backed results that are machine-recoverable from GitHub
  Actions artifacts, and
- older historical mixed local+CI publication tallies.

## XBOW runner

The XBOW runner (`src/xbow-runner.ts`, exposed as `pnpm xbow`) executes
pwnkit against the [XBOW validation benchmarks][xbow] — 104 Docker CTF
challenges covering SQLi, XSS, SSRF, deserialization, IDOR, auth bypass,
command injection, and other classic web bug classes.

### Benchmark source precedence

The runner locates the benchmark suite on disk using the following
precedence (first match wins):

1. `--benchmark-path <dir>` — use an existing local checkout as-is
2. `XBOW_PATH` environment variable — use an existing local checkout as-is
3. `--benchmark-repo <git-url>` — clone into a workspace cache dir
   (`$TMPDIR/pwnkit-xbow-cache/<slug>`) and reuse the clone on subsequent
   runs
4. Default `/tmp/xbow-benchmarks`

`--benchmark-repo` accepts either the GitHub short form (`owner/repo`)
or a full git URL (`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`, SSH specs, etc.).
Use `--benchmark-ref <branch|tag|sha>` to pin a specific ref.

### Examples

Run against upstream XBOW (note: several Docker builds are broken upstream):

```sh
pnpm --filter @pwnkit/benchmark xbow \
  --benchmark-repo xbow-engineering/validation-benchmarks \
  --agentic --limit 10
```

Run against the community patched fork (fixes all 104 Docker builds):

```sh
pnpm --filter @pwnkit/benchmark xbow \
  --benchmark-repo 0ca/xbow-validation-benchmarks-patched \
  --agentic
```

Run against Shannon's "cleaned" fork (strips comments, variable names,
filepaths, and rewrites Dockerfiles — the substrate Shannon used for
their 96.15% result):

```sh
pnpm --filter @pwnkit/benchmark xbow \
  --benchmark-repo KeygraphHQ/xbow-validation-benchmarks \
  --agentic
```

Use a local checkout without cloning:

```sh
pnpm --filter @pwnkit/benchmark xbow \
  --benchmark-path /path/to/my/xbow-fork \
  --agentic --limit 5
```

### CI (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/xbow-bench.yml` workflow exposes two
`workflow_dispatch` inputs that drive the same behavior:

- `benchmark_repo` — any XBOW-compatible source repo
  (default: `0ca/xbow-validation-benchmarks-patched`)
- `benchmark_ref` — optional branch/tag/sha inside that repo

The clone step in the workflow honors these inputs before any benchmark
runs, so scheduled and dispatched runs can easily target upstream, the
patched fork, or a cleaned fork for apples-to-apples comparisons.

### Other flags

See the header comment in `src/xbow-runner.ts` for the full flag list
(`--agentic`, `--white-box`, `--limit`, `--tag`, `--level`, `--only`,
`--start`, `--retries`, `--models`, `--fresh`, `--save-findings`,
`--runtime`, `--dry-run`, `--json`).

### Statistical evaluation (`--repeat N`)

A single XBOW solve is an anecdote, not a benchmark. On 2026-04-06 a
v1 sweep solved XBEN-061 in 8 turns with a `handoff,no-hiw,no-evidence`
feature combo; we promoted that to a "winning configuration" in a blog
post and on the public roadmap. The same afternoon, a v2 regression
test ran the same combo against the same challenge with a fresh
workspace and failed. The single solve was noise inside an estimated
20–40% per-attempt success rate — not a generalizable signal.

Issue [#81] is the fix: every `(challenge, configuration)` cell gets
run N independent times and the harness reports the per-attempt
success rate with a 95% **Wilson score** confidence interval before
anything gets promoted to a default. Wilson (not Wald / normal
approximation) because N is small and rates can be near 0 or 1, where
Wald produces degenerate intervals like `[0, 0]` or extends outside
`[0, 1]`.

#### Flags

```
--repeat N                         number of independent attempts per
                                   challenge (default 1)
--repeat-cost-ceiling-usd <amount> per-cell cost ceiling (default $5.00).
                                   Subsequent runs of a challenge are
                                   skipped once cumulative cost across
                                   attempts exceeds the ceiling; the
                                   result carries costCeilingHit: true.
```

Default reasoning for the cost ceiling: `$5/cell × 8 unsolved challenges
× n=10 = $40 max per sweep.` Affordable for a nightly CI job.

#### Recommended invocation (n=10 evaluation)

Run the n=10 harness over the 8 unsolved XBEN challenges with the
lean-scaffolding feature combo under investigation:

```sh
pnpm --filter @pwnkit/benchmark xbow \
  --agentic \
  --only XBEN-010,XBEN-051,XBEN-061,XBEN-066,XBEN-080,XBEN-084,XBEN-099,XBEN-104 \
  --repeat 10 \
  --repeat-cost-ceiling-usd 5.00 \
  --fresh --json
```

The CI workflow exposes the same via the `repeat` and
`repeat_cost_ceiling_usd` `workflow_dispatch` inputs on
`.github/workflows/xbow-bench.yml`.

#### JSON output schema

**When `--repeat 1` (default):** the `xbow-latest.json` shape is
**unchanged**. Same `results: [...]` array, no new fields, no
top-level `repeatProtocol`. Existing consumers that don't know about
`--repeat` keep working byte-for-byte.

**When `--repeat N > 1`:** a top-level `repeatProtocol` field appears:

```jsonc
{
  "timestamp": "…",
  "repeatProtocol": { "N": 10, "costCeilingUsd": 5.0 },
  "results": [ /* … */ ]
}
```

And each entry in `results[]` **adds** the aggregation fields while
**keeping** the legacy single-run fields populated from the first
attempt, so old consumers still see a recognizable shape:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "XBEN-061",
  "name": "IDOR in user profile",
  "level": 2,
  "tags": ["idor"],

  // Legacy single-shot fields — populated from the FIRST attempt.
  // `passed` / `flagFound` reflect "did any attempt solve it?" so
  // the top-level pass counter still means something in repeat mode.
  "passed": true,
  "flagFound": true,
  "attackTurns": 8,
  "estimatedCostUsd": 0.25,
  "durationMs": 42000,

  // n=10 aggregation fields.
  "attempts": 10,
  "passes": 3,
  "successRate": 0.3,
  "successRateCI95": [0.1078, 0.6032],
  "meanTurns": 10.5,
  "stdDevTurns": 2.4,
  "meanCostUsd": 0.35,
  "stdDevCostUsd": 0.1,
  "perRun": [
    { "runIndex": 0, "passed": true,  "turns": 8,  "cost": 0.25, "durationMs": 42000 },
    { "runIndex": 1, "passed": false, "turns": 12, "cost": 0.42, "durationMs": 68000 }
    // … 8 more
  ],
  "costCeilingHit": false
}
```

If a cell stops early because the `--repeat-cost-ceiling-usd` ceiling
was hit, `costCeilingHit: true` and `attempts < repeatProtocol.N` —
a reader can tell at a glance that the sample is smaller than the
requested N.

The Wilson CI computation and the aggregation logic live in
`src/wilson.ts` and are independently unit-tested in
`src/wilson.test.ts` (15 tests, including the k=0 / k=n boundary
clamps) and `src/xbow-runner.test.ts` (4 tests covering the repeat
harness with an injected fake `runOne`).
