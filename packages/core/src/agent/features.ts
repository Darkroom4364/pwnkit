 * Feature flags for A/B testing agent improvements.

 *
 * NOTE on defaults:
 *   - "stable" features (early stop, loop detection, context compaction,
 *     script templates) default ON.
 *   - "experimental" features (playbooks, memory, handoff, web search) default OFF.
 *   - "v0.6.0 FP moat layers" (povGate, reachabilityGate, multiModal,
 *     adversarialDebate, triageMemories, egatsTreeSearch,
 *     selfConsistencyVerify) ALSO default OFF — they need explicit enablement
 *     in CI before any FP-moat A/B claim can be made.
 *   - "always-on triage filters" (`holdingItWrong`, `evidenceGate`) default
 *     ON — they're the only filters that ran in every v0.6.0 ablation, so
 *     they need to be ablatable.
